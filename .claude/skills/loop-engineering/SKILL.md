description: Driving a code change or document update through reviewed research, plan, and design outputs → approval → execution → verification → independent review, including blocked verification, pending review/CI, and run recovery. Owns phase placement, approval revision, evidence, finding state, and recovery meaning—not generic deliverable-review method, check-failure diagnosis, host execution APIs, or delivery storage. Development practices own verification diagnosis; conduct practices own non-code deliverable review; project policy chooses gates and branches. Defer to a host project's own more-specific change loop where present. Not for standalone read-only questions, investigations, or reviews that change nothing.

# Loop Engineering

Drive one change from intake to ready through **plan → approve → execute → verify → independent review → address → ready**. This skill defines what each phase means and what evidence crosses its boundaries. It does not authorize tools, publication, scheduling, or delegation, and it does not prescribe where durable state is stored.

Project policy owns which change-delivery gates apply, external code-review independence, branch and delivery rules, and storage representations. Where policy is silent, use this skill's existing defaults: a human-approved plan before edits, required verification, mandatory independent review, append-only recovery, and a ready state only after convergence.

This skill does not assign priority between runtime-injected instructions and project mandates. Host entry guidance explains how to apply the active host's actual instruction hierarchy; it cannot redefine that hierarchy. Resolve conflicts using each instruction's actual source and priority, respect tool usage conditions, and report any project gate that cannot be satisfied within those boundaries.

The loop driver is the actor currently responsible for advancing a change against its approved plan and required evidence. When that driver delegates a contribution, it is the parent for that assignment. Launching a separately owned change does not make its launcher that change's driver. Receiving a result does not by itself transfer the loop, human decision authority, or operation grants.

Read-only work that changes nothing does not enter change gates. Implementation delegation, phase-deliverable review, and implementation pre-flight each need their own current qualification. An earlier available or unavailable route decides none of the others. Applicable host guidance owns actor and read routing; this skill keeps checkpoint evidence and progression. Driver execution never makes the driver its own independent reviewer.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html).

## Phase Progression

Every change advances against current evidence, never a claim inherited from an earlier phase.

The four rules below apply throughout a change and are needed before reference selection: whether this is change work, who owns it, whether checkpoint qualification is current, and what approval authorizes. They stay here under the unconditional-scope carve-out; checkpoint-specific evidence and procedures stay in their references.

Every other phase rule lives in the reference that governs it, including the plan gate and the staleness that follows a changed revision: [plan-document.md](./references/plan-document.md) states both for writing, approving, revising, or comparing a plan.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST treat read-only work as outside the change gates unless it produces a project change.
- MUST identify the loop driver and any contribution responsibilities from the assigned work and established handoff, not from execution ancestry.
- MUST qualify implementation delegation, phase-deliverable review, and implementation pre-flight independently at their own checkpoints under current host conditions; direct implementation and prior role availability or unavailability neither skip nor qualify another checkpoint, and weaken no gate.
- MUST distinguish plan approval, operation authorization, execution capability, and permitted tool use. Carry forward valid authorization within its original scope, including a verified standing grant a human adopted into project guidance, which is actual authorization; but never infer a grant, or a broader one, from tool availability, project policy that records none, plan approval, or a previous operation.

See [phase-progression.md](./references/phase-progression.md) for:

- anchoring a new change in its tracking target and making its first edit or branch operation, under intake and default gates
- running verification for a changed surface and opening or addressing a delivery target, under project policy and independent review
- choosing available actions when verification fails or review/CI is pending, identifying concrete dependencies and bounded machine waits
- reevaluating remaining gates after a current machine result, including readiness without a source edit

See [plan-document.md](./references/plan-document.md) for:

- writing, approving, revising, or comparing a plan
- the canonical plan sections and approval target
- agreeing necessary out-of-tree verification and its evidence destination during planning
- revision identity, amendment approval, and visual choices

See [reviewing-phase-deliverables.md](./references/reviewing-phase-deliverables.md) for:

- investigation conclusions before planning, plans before approval, and each low- then high-fidelity visual-option round before human selection or dependent work
- current artifact and required-material identity, reusable unchanged reviews, and recovery of consumed rounds through existing handoff state
- the conduct-owned completion boundary, the fallback when that review practice is absent even from an installed older conduct skill, and separation from implementation pre-flight and external code review

## Execution Handoffs

See [implementation-package.md](./references/implementation-package.md) for:

- assigning work or accepting an execution or review result through the five prose-compatible contracts
- repository identity, material fidelity, authorization, and result states

See [subagent-delegation.md](./references/subagent-delegation.md) for:

- qualifying an implementation assignment or a selected review checkpoint, including direct execution and a previously unavailable route
- assignment-specific grounds, relevant requalification changes, and conditional host-guidance defaults
- material-access preflight and integration of returned evidence without transferring whole-change responsibility

See [writer-ownership-and-recovery.md](./references/writer-ownership-and-recovery.md) for:

- coordinating concurrent writing, retrying an effect, or recovering an interrupted run, including plan-change interruption and outcome-unknown recovery
- append-only history and completion-evidence comparison

## Review and Readiness

See [finding-response.md](./references/finding-response.md) for:

- choosing an author-side response to an advisory pre-flight or independent-review finding through feedback judgment and causal correction selection
- the bounded response practice when conduct or development capabilities are absent
- response reasoning distinct from finding disposition and fresh-review input

See [pre-flight-review.md](./references/pre-flight-review.md) for:

- running or recovering an advisory pre-flight review
- advisory review findings, terminal states, deferred human handoffs, dismissal authority, and durable parks
- the initial implementation plus three autonomous review/fix rounds

See [independent-review.md](./references/independent-review.md) for:

- requesting, addressing, or evaluating an independent review, or publishing the ready transition
- mandatory external independence, fresh review rounds, and the four-round address cap
- identifiable posted completion under the project's adopted presentation and reporting scope, without affirmative per-check assertions, distinct from explicit limitations and contributor evidence
- external fixed, human-dismissed, and outstanding dispositions without rewriting reviewer history
- convergence distinct from conversation closure, including substantive metadata changes
- conflict remediation, affected verification, timeout, and ready conditions

## Resume and Reporting

See [resuming-and-handoff.md](./references/resuming-and-handoff.md) for:

- resuming or taking over a run by reconstructing actual state and resuming one pending phase
- handling stale, partial, and unknown outcomes

See [run-state-and-reporting.md](./references/run-state-and-reporting.md) for:

- persisting recoverable semantic run state independent of storage format, including separate checkpoint qualifications, actual review coverage, and their grounds
- evaluating a recovered or standing operation grant against a proposed effect across phases and sessions
- writing the evidence-backed ready-to-merge brief, and reporting a spawned role's model and effort as `verified`, `declared`, or `unknown`

What follows is the rule itself, not a further reading obligation. It binds every turn this loop takes rather than some narrower situation, so it stands here under the same unconditional-scope carve-out [Phase Progression](#phase-progression) invokes, instead of behind a pointer an agent might not yet have opened. An observation and the action it justifies belong in the same turn. A turn that carries text and calls no tool is not a turn taken while the work continues — the run has not stopped, so reporting first and acting next merely splits one turn's cost across two turns instead of doing the work in the one that already had it.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST act, in the same turn, on any observation that has a next step while the run continues — do not end a turn that reports and calls no tool when there is more to do.
- MUST treat exactly three cases as exceptions to that rule rather than violations of it: ending the turn at a required human gate, including a machine event escalated to one; recording state before stopping at a waiting bound; and the completion report that closes the run.
- MUST NOT apply this rule to a progress note posted while an asynchronous machine event is still outstanding — a required check, the independent review, or a delegated actor's run — when no independent next action is available; an outstanding event alone does not establish that condition.
- MUST NOT read this rule as barring reasoning alongside a tool call: it forbids splitting one turn into a text-only turn followed by the turn that acts, not writing prose in the same turn that also calls a tool.
